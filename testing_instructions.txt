HOW TO USE THE MAKEFILE TO TEST

step 1
	make sure that the source code you want to test is in this branch

step 2
	create a *test.c file in the ./test/ folder
	the test.c file needs to contain the main, and should return a non 0 if anything goes wrong

step 3
	run the cmd you want to run
		make test 
			runs all the tests and run valgrind
		make test_out
			same as test but stores all the logs in a log file inside of ./test/log/
