var="< file cat"
	do we need to handle this ?

cat | cat > file
	segfault

cd multiple args
	needs to give error

cd nonexistent_dir
	need to write err

cat << | < file && << | < file
bash
	shows syntax error near `|'
mini
	shows syntax error near `<<'


||||
bash
	syntax error near '||'
mini
	syntax error near '|'
